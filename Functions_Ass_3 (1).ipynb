        "Ans- Iterables:-\n",
        "Iterables are objects that can be looped over (iterated over). They include sequences like lists, tuples, strings, and other objects like dictionaries and sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "An iterable implements the __iter__() method, which returns an iterator.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples of Iterables:\n",
        "\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",

        "Iterators:-\n",
        "Iterators are objects that represent a stream of data. They produce data one element at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "An iterator implements two methods: __iter__() (returns itself) and __next__() (returns the next element).\n",
        "\n",
        "When an iterator is exhausted, it raises a StopIteration exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples of Iterators:\n",

        "\n",
        "Q 6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Generators in Python are a special type of iterator that allow you to generate values on the fly without storing them in memory all at once.\n",
        " They are particularly useful for working with large data sets or streams of data where you only need to process one item at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Features of Generators:\n",
        "Lazy Evaluation: Generators produce items only when requested, which makes them memory-efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "State Persistence: They maintain state between iterations, allowing them to resume where they left off.\n",
        "\n",
        "Defining Generators:\n",
        "Generators can be defined in two ways: using generator functions or generator expressions.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Generator Functions:\n",
        "A generator function is defined using the def keyword and the yield statement. Each call to yield produces a value and pauses the function, maintaining its state for subsequent calls.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "def count_up_to(max):\n",
        "    count = 1\n",
        "    while count <= max:\n",
        "        yield count\n",
        "        count += 1\n",
        "\n",
        "# Using the generator function\n",
        "counter = count_up_to(5)\n",
        "for number in counter:\n",
        "    print(number)\n",
        "Output:\n",
        "\n",
        "1\n",
        "2\n",
        "3\n",
        "4\n",
        "5\n",
        "2. Generator Expressions:\n",
        "Generator expressions are similar to list comprehensions but use parentheses instead of square brackets. They provide a concise way to create generators.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "squares = (x * x for x in range(1, 6))\n",
        "\n",
        "# Using the generator expression\n",
        "for square in squares:\n",
        "    print(square)\n",

        "1\n",
        "4\n",
        "9\n",
        "16\n",
        "25\n",
        "How Generators Work:\n",
        "When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object without executing the function. When next() is called on the generator object,\n",
        "the function executes until it hits a yield statement. The yield statement returns a value, and the function pauses, saving its state. When next() is called again,\n",
        "the function resumes where it left off.\n",
        "\n",
        "Benefits of Generators:\n",
        "Memory Efficiency: They produce values one at a time, which is more memory-efficient than storing a large list of values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Improved Performance: They can provide performance improvements when working with large data sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q  7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Using generators in Python offers significant advantages over regular functions, particularly when handling large datasets or streams of data. One key benefit is memory\n",
        " efficiency. Generators generate values on demand without storing the entire dataset in memory, making them ideal for large or infinite sequences. This is achieved through\n",
        "  lazy evaluation, where values are produced only when needed, reducing memory usage and improving performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators provide improved performance as they yield values one at a time and maintain state between iterations, unlike functions that return entire lists or data structures.\n",
        " Additionally, generators simplify code by replacing complex iteration protocols with cleaner, more readable generator functions, making the code easier to understand and maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another advantage is the ability to create infinite sequences, which is not feasible with regular functions that return finite collections. Generators can also build data\n",
        "processing pipelines, allowing for modular and efficient data processing. By chaining multiple generators, you can create streamlined workflows that process data in stages,\n",
        " enhancing code modularity and reusability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "python\n",
        "def infinite_numbers(start=0):\n",
        "    while True:\n",
        "        yield start\n",
        "        start += 1\n",
        "\n",
        "gen = infinite_numbers()\n",
        "for _ in range(5):\n",
        "    print(next(gen))  # Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, generators offer memory efficiency, lazy evaluation, improved performance, code simplicity, and support for infinite sequences and data pipelines.\n",
